# Discord-YouTube-Bot (that tells Dad Jokes)
YouTube Discord bot that tells dad jokes and posts the latest uploads for specified YouTube channels.

## Technologies
This bot is coded entirely with Python.

Discord.py is the python library that I used that powers the communication to Discord's bot API.

I used the "icanhazdadjoke.com" API to access a large selection of Dad jokes.
